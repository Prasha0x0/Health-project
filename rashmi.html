        <h2> ABSTRACT</h2>
	<h3>
        <p>
           Basic Health Monitoring System  develops a health monitoring system using the ESP32 microcontroller,
            equipped with various sensors to measure critical health and environmental parameters. The system monitors
            body temperature, room temperature, heart rate (BPM), oxygen levels, blood pressure, pulse rate, UV exposure,
            air quality, and particulate matter. Sensor data is displayed on an LCD screen and recorded on a backend server
            accessible through a dedicated website. The website features patient information management, electronic health
            records, sensor data visualization, and hospital information. Additionally, the system incorporates a GSM module 
            to send emergency alerts to doctors, ensuring timely medical intervention. 
            This system aims to provide efficient and real-time health monitoring.

    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2> 
    <h4> 
        <p> 
            In the field of healthcare, the integration of electronics, communication, and information technologies has
            led to the development of innovative solutions for health monitoring and management. The emergence of hardware-based 
            systems combined with intelligent software platforms has enabled real-time monitoring of vital health parameters, 
            offering valuable insights into individual well-being and facilitating proactive healthcare interventions.
            Traditional health monitoring systems rely on standalone medical devices to measure physiological parameters such as pulse rate, 
            bpm, oxygen level, blood pressure, etc. These devices utilize sensors and measurement techniques tailored to specific health 
            indicators, providing accurate and reliable data for clinical assessment and diagnostic purposes.
